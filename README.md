# Spotify Daily

Using the spotify API, this app recommends songs to the user and gives the user an overview of their most listened to songs/genres in sublime charts.

### Purposes

- Learn the Spotify API
- Learn how to create views programmatically
- Refine understanding of RxSwift
- Useful for me since I listen to Spotify a lot and would like to tailor the recommendation system to recommend better songs for me

### Deadline

- Finished criteria: full implementation of dashboard, the user charts with most listened to songs, genres, authors, and the song recommender
- Deadline: December 25
- Plan: Code for at least 2 hours daily. Use ClickUp to manage tasks and subtasks that need to be done.
